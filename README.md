This paper focuses on the development of data structures such as stacks, lists, binary trees and their implementation using Python.
binary tree - entering a node in the tree, finding the node by key, output node data, delete the node, bypass the tree, output all nodes, destroy the tree.

Task:
implement the code according to your version in Python
Code should be added to github (separate repository in Github, code should be added as PR)


- Binary tree
- Instrument:
  type of device (voltmeter, etc.),
  device brand (B-16A, etc.),
  measurement limit,
  year of creation
- inserting a node according to the brand of the device;
  output of all nodes with a measurement limit not lower than specified;
  removal of all nodes with a given year of issue;
  top-down tree traversal
